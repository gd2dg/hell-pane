Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find A better place to play
You said that you'd never been But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head.
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
# Stand up beside the fireplace
# Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
# And so Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as we're walking on by
# Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
But please don't put your life in the hands Of a Rock n Roll band
Who'll throw it all away
