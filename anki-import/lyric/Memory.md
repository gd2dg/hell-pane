Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through

Toast to ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, ay

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost
When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop (Ooh yeah)
Now my heart feel like an ember['ɛmbɚ] and it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop, yeah

ember ['ɛmbɚ] n. 灰烬，余烬
